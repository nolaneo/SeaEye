* Optional: Add the users and branches you want to follow.
* Don't want desktop notifications? Turn them off!

### FAQ

*My builds won't load*
* Make sure you're using your own personal Circle CI token and not the repo specific token. Otherwise ensure that you've spelt the names of your projects correctly. If that doesnt work, try use cURL to hit the Circle API with your token and open an issue if you get back good data.

*I broke SeaEye, how do I force quit?*
* :( SeaEye doesn't show up in the simple Force Quit window because it's an agent app. This means you'll need to close it from Activity Monitor.

---
### TODO
* Add paste support to the settings page.
